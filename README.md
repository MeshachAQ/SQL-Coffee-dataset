# ABOUT PROJECT DATA
The coffee order dataset provides insights into customer purchasing behavior across various coffee types, sizes, and roast types by this coffee shop company. It captures key variables such as customer preferences, seasonal trends and top customers. it contains three different sheets namely: Products, Orders and Customers.
What tool did I use for this analysis? I basically used SQL in deriving insights towards business goals and objectives.

# WHAT ARE THE KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS FOR THIS ANALYSIS?
1. What coffee products generates the most revenue?
2. What are the best-selling coffee types, roast types or sizee?
3. Are there seasonal trends in order volume?
4. Who are the top customers by revenue?
5. What countries or cities contributed the most revenue?

# WHAT ARE MY GOALS OF TACKLING THIS ASSIGNMENT AS AN ANALYST WORKING FOR THIS COFFEE SHOP COMPANY?
1. To analyze sales and customer behavior in order to improve business performance
2. To help the business optimize it's product offerings and pricing strategies.
3. Support data-driven decision making across departments.

# WHAT WERE MY OBSERVATIONS GOING IN TO TACKLE THIS PROJECT?
1. First and fore most, I had to make use of the joins function as it is required, that the various data sheets demanded to be joined for the full data insight.
2. The data demanded certain data cleaning and standardization.
3. I also needed to track KPIS like total Sales, Average Sales and quantities ordered.
4. I also looked at the customer segmentation by geography, loyalty status and order patterns.

# STEPS I TOOK TOWARDS THIS PROJECT INCLUDES

1. Data Cleaning & STANDARDIZATION
2. Data analysis
3. Recommendations
4. Conclusion.

# Data Cleaning



# Data Analysing

Here we had to get insight from the dataset to help in management decision making and so some of the questions we answered is included in the pictures below;![COFFEE SQL 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4e12312-f829-40ee-beb5-40402a8f9ce6)

we also showcase the queries we wrote to derive these insights where we made use of alot of multiple joins functions since the dataset is contained in three different sheets.
We didn't perform any visuals on this dataset for now

# Recommendations
Management should provide goods that sell more per city to those cities and make inquiries as to why certain products sell less at these cities. This way, managers can decide to either improve the quality of those goods at hose cities or focus on providing more of those goods to cities that prefer them
Management should also look at the monthly trend of the goods. Do they sell more at certain months by a very high high margin? if yes, it means we need to focus on providing more during those times than on less selling months in each city
Who are the top buying customers, and if we can give them something to entice them more, we can also learn why they love the types of products and based on that target their kinds with the types of products these top buyers enjoy the most.

# Conclusion

Taking on this project has helped me practice my newly acquired skill and has helped build my confidence;

I successfully cleaned a raw data , transformed and analyzed it mainly with sql and applied MULTIPLE JOIN function. something I wasn't so confident about initially.
